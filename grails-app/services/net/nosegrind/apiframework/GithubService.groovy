/** NOTICE::
Since I have ALOT of lurkers who don't download but don't contribute, I wanted to say hi...

I wanted to personally thank all of you using and downloading the code especially the OCI/Grails team and 
all their enterprise customers the BeAPI project supports.

As you know we have had Facebook make overtures to try to steal our work and now it seems our user base got 
rattled and wants to either get the code for themselves or make sure that it STAYS OPEN.

The surest way you can make sure the code stays open is through support: donate, star the project, and contribute.

Otherwise yes, without support, open source projects eventually do move towards proprietary ends.
 
This is one of many reasons why we keep separate code branchs for PRO versions which we implement for paid clients.

So if you wish to keep this project open, please contribute.

Thanks :)
